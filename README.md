For implementation, we used the OpenCV python library - this is an open source computer vision library that is designed for analyzing, classifying and processing images to solve computer vision problems. OpenCV has a function to read video, which is cv2. We also used the haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml XML file, which contains a pre-trained model created as a result of rigorous training. The model uses an adaptive boost algorithm for better results and accuracy. First, enable the main webcam by passing 0 as a parameter (If you have a secondary webcam, you can change 0 to 1). Read the video stream and display it in the window. For face detection, we loaded the Haarcascade "haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml".

To avoid any interference, we will convert the image read from the webcam to grayscale. We will use a grayscale image for face detection. After defining the face and drawing a rectangle surrounding the face. The variable Faces will have length, width, height and width. We will use them as coordinates to build a rectangle. The parameters passed when drawing the rectangle are the actual image, start coordinates, end coordinates, color used, border width.
